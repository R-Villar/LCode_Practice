## Summary
The `two_sum` function takes a list of numbers and a target value as input and returns a list containing the indices of two numbers from the list that add up to the target value. If no such pair is found, an empty list is returned.

## Example Usage
```python
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
result = two_sum(nums, target)
print(result)
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `nums` (List[int]): The list of numbers to search for pairs.
- `target` (int): The target value to find the sum of two numbers.
___
### Flow
1. Create an empty dictionary called `value_to_index_map` to store the mapping of values to their indices.
2. Iterate over the list of numbers `nums` using the `enumerate` function to get both the index `i` and the number `n`.
3. Calculate the difference between the target value and the current number (`diff = target - n`).
4. Check if the difference `diff` exists as a key in the `value_to_index_map` dictionary.
5. If the difference `diff` exists in the dictionary, it means we have found a pair of numbers that add up to the target value. Return a list containing the indices of the two numbers (`[value_to_index_map[diff], i]`).
6. If the difference `diff` does not exist in the dictionary, add the current number `n` as a key in the dictionary with its index `i` as the value.
7. If no pair of numbers is found that add up to the target value, return an empty list.

### Outputs
- A list containing the indices of two numbers from the input list that add up to the target value. If no such pair is found, an empty list is returned.
